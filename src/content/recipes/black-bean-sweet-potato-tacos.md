### Ingredients

- 2 medium sweet potatoes, peeled and diced
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 teaspoon chili powder
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- 1 can (15 oz) black beans, drained and rinsed
- 1 cup corn kernels (fresh or frozen)
- 1/2 red onion, finely chopped
- 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro

### Avocado Crema

- 1 ripe avocado, peeled and pitted
- 1/4 cup plain Greek yogurt

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 400Â°F (200Â°C).

2. In a large bowl, toss diced sweet potatoes with olive oil, chili powder, cumin, salt, and pepper until evenly coated. Spread in a single layer on a baking sheet. Roast for 20-25 minutes, stirring halfway through, until sweet potatoes are tender and lightly browned.

4. In a small bowl, combine drained black beans, corn kernels, chopped red onion, and fresh cilantro.

5. Heat tortillas according to package instructions or preference.
