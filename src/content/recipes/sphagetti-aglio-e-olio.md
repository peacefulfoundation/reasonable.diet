**Prep Time:** 10 minutes  
**Cook Time:** 15 minutes  
**Servings:** 2

### Ingredients

- 200g spaghetti
- 4 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
- 1/4 cup olive oil
- 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes (adjust to taste)
- Salt, to taste
- Freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
- Grated Parmesan cheese (optional, for serving)

### Directions

1. Cook spaghetti in a large pot of boiling salted water until al dente. Drain well and reserve 1/2 cup of pasta water.

2. In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add garlic and cook, stirring frequently, until garlic is golden brown and crispy, about 2-3 minutes. Be careful not to burn the garlic.

3. Add red pepper flakes to the skillet and stir for another 30 seconds.

4. Add the cooked spaghetti to the skillet. Toss to coat the pasta evenly with the garlic oil mixture. If the pasta seems dry, add some of the reserved pasta water a little at a time until desired consistency is reached.

5. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. Stir in chopped parsley.

6. Serve immediately, garnished with grated Parmesan cheese if desired.
